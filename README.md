#Bungalow streaming client

An open source streaming client based on LibSpotify (currently) and Node-webkit. 

My goal is to create a parallell world spotify client that adds a Spotify Apps like API.

Spotify functionality is encapsulated so it can be substituted with any other music streaming API and theme change aswell, so this also will be a open source cross music service player like Tomahawk with integrate app API functionality. Should we change from Spotify we just change the theme and music service class, and will also support custom skinning and multiple music sources aswell.
