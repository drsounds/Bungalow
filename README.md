#Bungalow streaming client

An open source streaming client based on LibSpotify and Node-webkit. 

My goal is to create a parallell world spotify client that adds a Spotify Apps like API.

Spotify functionality is encapsulated so it can be substituted with any other music streaming API and theme change aswell, so this also will be a open source cross music service player like Tomahawk with integrate app API functionality.
